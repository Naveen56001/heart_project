# Heart Disease Prediction using Machine Learning and Explainable AI Techniques

This is a heart disease prediction system using Machine Learning and Explianble AI Techniques. Xgboost has been used for the prediction, along with SHAP (Shapley Additive eXplanations) feature, SHAP extracts the most important features which helped in the prediction. A patient can reduce the risk of heart disease if he/she focus on those features and take care of their health accordingly.

For explaining the prediction made by Xgboost along with the SHAP values, the phi-3 model from ollama has been used. The phi model takes into account the prediction and shap values and explains why that particular prediciton being made (yes/no). And it also gives recommendations on how to improve their health and which factors to focus more on.
